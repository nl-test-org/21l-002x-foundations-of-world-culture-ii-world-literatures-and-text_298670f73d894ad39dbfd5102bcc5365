Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This class continues our study of the foundational texts of human culture, focusing on early modernity until the recent past. In many ways, this includes several questions such as: Why did these works achieve the fame and influence they achieved? How do they present what it means to be a human being? How do they describe the role of a member of a family, community, tradition, social class, gender? How do they distinguish between proper and improper behavior? How do they characterize the members of other groups? However, in several ways, these texts are also iconoclastic, breaking with centuries of established tradition to shed light on previously unexplored subjects, such as the status of women in society or the legacy of the colonial expansion of European countries. They also question well-established social beliefs like religion, monarchical rule and human nature in general.

Class Rules
-----------

1.  Class attendance is mandatory.
2.  You are expected to prepare yourself for each class by doing the reading for each session in advance.

Assignments
-----------

1.  A minimum of 20 pages of writing, in 3–5 assignments.
2.  Revision and resubmission of at least one of the assignments.
3.  An oral component.

This course will be reading and writing-intensive. Each week, you will be required to submit two questions that you have come up with that you think will enrich our class discussions the next day.

You will have three writing assignments. These 7–8 page essays will be based on essay questions that will be handed out in class a week prior to the submission date. You are expected to formulate a coherent argument and support it with material from the books that you have read. For more information, please see the Assignments section.

You will need to revise one of your first two essays; you may choose which one. You must revise at least one of your first two papers.

You will also be responsible for a brief (15–20 minute) oral presentation on the topic of your choice.
